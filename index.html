          <p>「Letter to Young Artists During a Global Pandemic」</p>
          <p>Paul Chan</p>
          <p>Really conceptual to me</p>
     
          <br>
        
     
          <p>Homer</p>
          <p>  "Trouble is what you find and what you must endure if you wish to gain an identity.<br>
             This is why going home was considered a form of self-expression for Homer and the Greeks. "</p>
     
             <p> Rumors</p>
     
             <p>"The practice of working artists at whatever station in life is, at best, uncertain and precarious. 
             There is no recipe for making good work. But generally, artists learn to recast their lot to suit 
             how they need to express what it means to be someone."</p>
             <br>
     
             <p>I was reading an interview about Paul's another artwork "erotica"， <br>
                 he was not sure what he was doing, but he has learnt a lot from the process <br>
                 maybe we all do not need that much "problem-solving" in our design life.</p>
             <br>
             
             <p>Origin</p>
     
                 <p>"The goal is now not to go back to a past. The goal is to find or discover what is new.<br>
                     Better yet, to find what is worth beginning anew."<br>
                     Remind me of this pandemic, we were saying about how to get past life back all the time <br>
                     Maybe we could not go back anymore, time to adapt.
                 </p>

                <p>‘Hello, Arthur Dent, your house is going to be crushed.’</p>
                
                <p>This is like a performance art.</p>

               <p> "How big is the Web? It turns out, he said, that it’s twenty feet by eight 
                 feet by eight feet, or, at least, it was on the day he measured it. How much 
                 did it weigh? Twenty- six thousand pounds. He thought that meant something. 
                 He thought people needed to know that."</p>

                 <p>It is interesting that the innovators were really thinking of the measurement 
                   of the internet to me</p>

                   <p>Turns out a web library is not quiet ironically. It needs fans to cool the machines down</p>
